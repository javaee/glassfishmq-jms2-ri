/**
 * An XATopicSession provides a regular TopicSession which can be used to
 * create TopicSubscribers and TopicPublishers (optional).
 *
 * <P>XASession extends the capability of Session by adding access to a JMS
 * provider's support for JTA (optional). This support takes the form of a
 * <CODE>javax.transaction.xa.XAResource</CODE> object. The functionality of
 * this object closely resembles that defined by the standard X/Open XA
 * Resource interface.
 *
 * <P>An application server controls the transactional assignment of an
 * XASession by obtaining its XAResource. It uses the XAResource to assign
 * the session to a transaction; prepare and commit work on the
 * transaction; etc.
 *
 * <P>An XAResource provides some fairly sophisticated facilities for
 * interleaving work on multiple transactions; recovering a list of
 * transactions in progress; etc. A JTA aware JMS provider must fully
 * implement this functionality. This could be done by using the services
 * of a database that supports XA or a JMS provider may choose to implement
 * this functionality from scratch.
 *
 * <P>A client of the application server is given what it thinks is a
 * regular JMS Session. Behind the scenes, the application server controls
 * the transaction management of the underlying XASession.
